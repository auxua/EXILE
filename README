EXILE - The EXtensible Indoor Localization Emulator

== What is this? ==

This is an emulator which was developed during the bachelor thesis at RWTH Aachen University about Integrating Orthognal Localization Methods. (if you are interested: http://datp.de/thesis/thesis.pdf )
This Emulator uses formatted data of runs to emulate the behaviour of the localization modules.


== What modules? ==

Currently there are implementations for Mobile Tagging (e.g. QR Codes), Step Detection and matching, Wifi Fingerprinting, Floor Color and GPS.


== What about details? ==

You can find them in the thesis and in the javadoc.


== What systems/APIs/Applications have been used/are needed ==

The Android Application WiFiWar (see my other repos) has been used for simply collecting Wifi Fingerprints (having a map of the area)
The maps come from the OpenStreetmap Project ( http://osm.org )
The data has been collected by using the dCollector Android Application initially developed by Felix Gerdsmeier.
